<p>Before relying on a new experimental device, an experimental scientist always establishes its accuracy. A new detector is calibrated when the scientist observes its responses to known input signals. The results of this calibration are compared against the <em>expected</em> response. <strong>An experimental scientist would never conduct an experiment with uncalibrated detectors - that would be unscientific. So, too, simulations and analysis with untested software do not constitute science.</strong></p>

<p><strong>You can only know by testing it well.</strong> Software bugs hide even in the most trivial software. Testing is the process by which those bugs are systematically identified and exterminated–hopefully before causing a system failure, paper retraction, or worse. Software tests, like device calibration, compare expected results against observed results in order to establish accuracy.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p>The collection of all tests for a given piece of code is known as the <em>test suite</em>. You can think of the test suite as a bunch of pre-canned experiments that anyone can run. If all of the entire test suite passes, then the code is at least partially trustworthy. If any test fails, then either the code or the test itself is broken for that specific case. After this lesson, you will know not to trust software for which a) the test suite fails or b) the tests do no <em>cover</em> its full range of capabilities.</p>

<div class="panel-body">
<p>In the same way that your scientific domain has expectations concerning experimental accuracy, it likely also has expectations concerning allowable computational accuracy. These considerations should surely come into play when you evaluate the acceptability of your own or someone else’s software.</p>

</aside>
<p>In many programming endeavors, code can be fundamentally wrong – even for many years – with minimal impact. Perhaps a website goes down, or a game crashes, or a day’s worth of writing is lost due to a bug in your word processor. Scientific code, on the other hand, controls planes, weapons systems, satellites, agriculture, and scientific simulations and experiments. If the software that governs a simulation is wrong, e.g., a false claim in a publication can be catastrophic to the author’s career and even tarnish the reputation of their field.</p>
<p>This is not to say that scientists have a monopoly on software testing, simply that software cannot be called <em>scientific</em> unless it has been validated.</p>

<h2 id="why-untested-code-is-legacy-code"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pushpin"></span>Why Untested Code is Legacy Code</h2>
</div>
<div class="panel-body">
<p>In <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Michael-Feathers/dp/0131177052/">Working Effectively with Legacy Code</a></em>, Michael Feathers defines legacy code as “any code without tests”. This definition draws on the fact that, after its initial creation, tests provide a powerful guide to other developers (and to your forgetful self, a few months into the future) about how each function is meant to be used. Without runnable tests to provide examples of code use, maintaining even brand new programs quickly becomes unsustainable.</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p>Testing is the calibration step of the computational simulation and analysis world: it lets the scientist trust their own work on a fundamental level and helps others to understand and trust their work as well. Furthermore, tests ensure that you never have to fix a bug a second time. Once a bug has been caught and a test has been written, that particular bug can never again re-enter the codebase unnoticed. This also makes it a lot easier to rewrite substantial portions of the system without fear of breaking related pieces of code. Whether motivated by principles or a desire to work more efficiently, all scientists can benefit from testing.</p>
